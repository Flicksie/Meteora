# Intro
Meteora is an old Discord bot project that I worked on for a few months. It's the successor of Altair, previously developed in JavaScript serving music functionalities, as Meteora did.
For personal reasons, I stopped developing the bot after a long journey. However, the source code is now public for those interested in such thing.

## This repo is archieved and Meteora is discontinued. Features won't be update and the bot won't be developed anymore.
